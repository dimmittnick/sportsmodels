can create visualization for each tournament highlighting its unique features and what the golfer splits look like

for example, for sentry tournament, could do location in hawaii or no cut events to see who overperforms in those situations. can make it pretty and include the traditional stuff also, shots gained and rolling averages, etc.

trying to think of categorical variables for each player such as shot preference (fade draw, handedness, course specifications (grass, distance, slope rating, greens, etc.))
